                    <p><strong>
                        <mark>NOTE : Avoid the temptation to check on your computer while it's still on. You could cause further damage it.
                        </mark>
                    </strong>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Shut down</strong> – the first thing that you need to do is to power off your
                            laptop. Don’t waste
                            time doing it the regular way (from the Start Menu); simply put your finger on the power
                            button and keep it pressed for 4 seconds to force a quick shut down.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Power outlet</strong> – if the laptop was plugged into a power outlet, take out the
                            power chord
                            first from your laptop then unplug it from the outlet. In case it was near the spillage
                            area, make sure that you leave the cable with the plug (the one that goes into the laptop)
                            hanging down, so that the water doesn’t get any further than it already did. Once again, do
                            this as quickly as possible; if the water makes its way into the power outlet it could
                            compromise your entire electrical grid.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Battery </strong>– the next step that you should take is to remove the battery, but
                            make sure not to
                            close the lid when you do that. Your laptop will keep certain parts powered even when it’s
                            turned down, so removing the last remaining power source is advisable. However, if you don’t
                            have the right kind of screwdriver or if you have a non-removable battery you can skip this
                            step.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong> Other components</strong> – remove everything else that’s easy to unplug: mouse,
                            keyboard, cards,
                            USB cables. Furthermore, if you know how to and if it doesn’t take you too long to remove
                            them, you should also take out the RAM and the hard drive. However, you should try to do
                            this without moving your laptop around too much so that the water doesn’t reach any new
                            areas.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Drying </strong>– take a towel and carefully, but thoroughly, dry the outside and
                            the places that you
                            can reach. Once that’s done put a dry towel on a table or on a clear surface, open the
                            laptop as wide as you can and put it face down on the towel. Wait for about 6 hours, then if
                            the laptop dried, try putting it back together and see if it will work. In case it doesn’t,
                            take it to a professional and see if he can help you out.Rice can also work as an amazing
                            drying agent.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Remember to isolate yourself from static discharge.</p>
