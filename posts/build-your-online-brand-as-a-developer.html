                    <p>In this information age it is crucial to stay discoverable by recruiters as is to stay
                        connected with friends/family or to express yourself. Using your blog, social media, GitHub and
                        online presence to highlight your passion for you craft will help you stand out from the crowd.
                    </p>

                    <h2>1. A Personal Blog</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Put in a little effort and time to write about your learnings. Even if you’re a beginner, even if
                        you don’t think highly of your skills, even if you think what you just learned is obvious. There
                        will always be someone who started programming after you did, and to whom the same thing isn’t
                        obvious at all.</p>

                    <p>If your blog posts are providing value to developers (of any level), they will be shared. You
                        will also gain exposure. When you apply for a job and the prospective employer searches your
                        name — they will find your blog and learn more about you.</p>

                    <h2 class="turf">2. A Personal Website</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Have descriptive and captivating summary of yourself, skills, education, industry, location all
                        set up.</p>
                    <p>This isn’t about getting 1,000’s of visitors to your website. This is about developing a personal
                        brand. And ultimately, it’s about what happens when a prospective employer or customer types
                        your name into Google search.</p>

                    <h2 class="turf">3. GitHub</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Knowing your way around a word processor is crucial to getting the most out of your computer. You
                        should be familiar with the following before you proceed further:</p>

                    <p>Nowadays almost everyone expects all developers to have side projects and be involved in open
                        source. It is important to give back, but remember that everyone should do it in their own way
                        and time.</p>
                    <p>Being active on GitHub is great, but if you are never going to finish those projects, delete
                        them. You need to make sure that any hiring manager or recruiter is seeing the projects that you
                        have completed and the ones that you are proud of</p>

                    <h2 class="turf">4. Local & Regional Meetups</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Volunteer to give talks at local meetups (or conferences / events) on any of topic of your
                        interest. The idea is to share your knowledge. There are so many meetup organizers always
                        looking for speakers for their next meetup. This will make you stand out as an expert in your
                        area of work.</p>

                    <h2 class="turf">5. A Custom Domain</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Having a good domain name goes without saying for the website. Try and get yourname.com if you
                        can, but if that’s occupied go for an .io, .co, .me or a country specific top level domain. If
                        none of that works play with your name and the domain a little bit, for example
                        “kelvinkamau.me”.</p>

                    <p>If you want extra geek points you can buy not just the domain yourname.com but also
                        surname.com. That way you can have an email address that looks like this: hello@yourname.com.
                        Pretty cool, right?</p>

                    <h2 class="turf">Why You Should Invest in Branding Yourself</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Everyone of us holds a brand-value of oneself. We represent our own professional brand. For
                        example, If you are an employee at a company and decide to move from company A to company B, you
                        carry your brand along with you. You represent your own brand. Therefore, your focus should be
                        always on making the brand YOU bigger, more valuable and more visible to the world.</p>

                    <p>
                        <mark class="red"><strong>Once you become a brand in your professional field, the world will
                            come seeking you.</strong></mark>
